              <h2>Project: Big Knob     <span class="text-muted">Jan/Feb 2019</span> </h2>
              <p></p>
              <p>I saw a cool video (link here) of a simple wood+resin pour project. There are plenty of similar craft videos out there, but I like this guy. The idea is, 
                  you break off a piece of wood to a live, jagged edge, pour resin over it, and shape and polish the piece as a whole to your whims.
              </p>
              <p>I decided to give it a quick shot. Made a couple decorative test pieces, then hit upon an idea for a grander project: a new shift knob for my Trooper.
              </p>

              <p><img src="/Photos/knob_1.jpg" width="600" height="600">  First thing to do: get a decent-sized chunk of nice wood (big enough to cut down to an approximately
                knob-sized diameter), and break off a piece. This actually gave me a bit of trouble: with my smaller tests, I had used a vise to apply pressure and snap a piece
                "cleanly" down the middle.</p>
              <p>That certainly wasn't possibly with this hunkin' chunk of wood-- way too big. My next idea was to prop it up on a couple rocks in my backyard and smash a
                  sledgehammer clean through it (Protip-safety glasses). Hey, even if it didn't work, it's always fun to swing a bigass hammer at stuff.
              </p>
              <p>Well, after smashing a few rocks to smithereens and driving a couple more headfirst into the dirt, I was finally able to get a workable piece. After a quick
                  drilled hole, it was ready to pop on the gear selector for an initial look.
              </p>
              <br>

              <p><img src="/Photos/knob_2.jpg" width="600" height="600">  After the initial installation, it was time to do the thing for real. I chopped off the excess wood on 
                the bottom, mixed up the resin (simple 1:1 ratio + some colorant), and waited for my creation to harden. 24 hours later, the rough shape was ready to start working on.</p>
              <br>

              <p><img src="/Photos/knob_3.jpg" width="600" height="600">  Sanding. So much sanding. The belt sander makes short work of wood and resin alike; pictured is the knob after
                roughing out the facets. Making flat faces, rather than a contoured form, makes it easier to control the next step: hand sanding. Working on the dining table with some choice
                jams on in the background, it's a labor of love: working each face up through finer grit sandpaper until I got the silky-smooth product I was looking for.</p>
              <p>Seriously, touching this thing after 2000-grit passes felt gooood.</p>
              <br>

              <p><img src="/Photos/knob_6.jpg" width="600" height="600">  Endgame. A couple layers of polyurethane to seal it, plus some polishing, and it was ready to pop off.
                A quick hole in the bottom, and we're ready for install!</p>
              <p><img src="/Photos/knob_7.jpg" width="600" height="600">  Crappy post-install pic. Did I mention it glows in the dark? Neat!</p>
