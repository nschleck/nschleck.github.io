            <p>Note: this is Part 2 of my ongoing Diplomacy project: Part 1 can be found <a href="/diplomacy.html">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>Alright, quick intro time: One of my favorite boardgames is an old one called “Diplomacy.” If you’re unfamiliar, think “Risk” -- trying to outmaneuver 
              opponents and occupy territories with your army pieces -- mixed with healthy elements of bluffing, strategy, and of course, diplomacy with the other players. 
              <img src="/Photos/diplo_board_3.jpg" style='float:right;width:400px;height:400px; margin-left:10px;'>
              Anyway, since I’ve been playing a socially-distant version with some friends, I figured it was a good time to take a crack at making my own game board (I 
              don’t already own the game, myself). Originally, it started with just a sketch on the whiteboard, which eventually developed into a desired to create an actual board.
            
            </p>
            <p>The traditional gameboard focuses on Europe, dividing up the continent and some surrounding regions into more-or-less historically accurate pre- World War 1 
              territories. At the beginning of the game, most of these territories are controlled (and color-coordinated) by one of the seven player-controlled Powers: Great Britain, 
              France, Italy, Germany, Turkey, Russia, and Austria-Hungary.
            </p>

            <p><img src="/Photos/diplo_board_4.jpg" style='float:left;width:400px;height:400px; margin-right:20px;'>My first task was to get the coastal outline on the piece of plywood 
              I had chosen for the board. I found an image of the traditional board layout online, overlaid a grid in Photoshop, and recreated this grid on my physical board. Then, it was 
              just a matter of painstakingly replicating the image, cell by cell, until I had a complete and relatively accurate coastline. However, all my hard work was soon undone by 
              poor planning.
            </p>
            <hr class="featurette-divider">
            <p><img src="/Photos/diplo_board_5.jpg" style='float:right;width:400px;height:400px; margin-left:10px;'>It was at this point that I decided to paint in the water. I settled on a technique of overlaying darker blue hues and white, brushing them back and forth 
              repeatedly, to create some texture and contrast in my water -- I didn’t want a single, bland shade of water. However, this technique had the downside of completely 
              covering the coastlines (and grid system) that I had so laboriously laid out. My solution, after some head-scratching, was to use yarn stretched across the board to 
              temporarily recreate my grid, and use this to lay out my coastline once more.<img src="/Photos/diplo_board_6.jpg" style='float:left;width:400px;height:400px; margin-right:10px;'>

            <p><img src="/Photos/diplo_board_9.jpg" style='float:right;width:400px;height:400px; margin-left:10px;'>Next, I started painting in the different colors used for the 
              player nations and unclaimed territories -- I decided to mix in some white at each color’s border, to make them pop a bit and add some visual interest -- while 
              there is some variance, I think this turned out really well. Lacking my grid once again, I eyeballed the secondary, internal territory lines. It was at this point 
              that I was stepping back and looking at the project, and starting to get really proud of how it was coming together.
            </p>

            <p>The final pieces were quick -- some labels and a few coats 
              of polyurethane, and it was a wrap! I also printed and painted a bunch of game pieces (little army and navy tokens), so now the game is fully playable, and I think 
              it turned out great.<br><br><br><br>
