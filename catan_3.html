            <h2>Project: Catan Mounted Board     <span class="text-muted">September 2020</span> </h2>
            <p>Note: this is Part 3 of my 3D printed Catan project: Part 1 can be found <a href="/catan.html">here</a>, and Part 2 can be found <a href="/catan_2.html">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>Some background -- I’ve invested a lot of time and effort into creating a 3D printed Catan set, which I learned a lot from and am really proud of. However, 
                for the last couple years, it has been moving around from various shelves, boxes, and cupboards. I had originally wanted to create a nice box for it, with foam 
                and felt interior to protect the pieces. However, I recently realized that what would be really cool would be to create a mountable board to display the project 
                prominently, turning it into a cool piece of prominent, focal wall art.
            </p>

            <hr class="featurette-divider">

            <p><img src="/Photos/catan_board_1.jpg" style='float:left;width:400px;height:400px; margin-right:20px;'>The biggest design challenge to tackle right off the bat was, 
                how to mount the pieces to the board? I thought about several potential solutions: magnets, velcro, sticky stuff. Ultimately, I settled on a design that I think 
                is simple, functional, and very attractive: cutting strips of aluminum into small sections and bending them into a shape with an eyebolt-like cross-section, I could use 
                the flexibility of the aluminum and mount the strips in such a way that I could push a piece into place between two of the strips, where it would be held firmly in 
                place by its edge. That’s all a bit convoluted to explain, so hopefully the pictures do a good job of demonstrating the idea. 
                <img src="/Photos/catan_board_4.jpg" style='float:right;width:400px;height:400px; margin-left:10px;'> </p>


            <p>The one big downside of the aluminum strip design is that, although they look very good when all the pieces are mounted, the aluminum loops block some of 
                the indents on the pieces that were originally designed to hold “road” tiles while playing the game. Designed as such, you can’t play a game of Catan while 
                the pieces are attached to the board; they have to be removed and set up again separately on a different surface. Since this was the best and most attractive 
                solution to the wall-mounting problem, I decided to live with this drawback.
            </p>
            <hr class="featurette-divider">
            <p><img src="/Photos/catan_board_3.jpg" style='float:right;width:400px;height:400px; margin-left:10px;'>Next, I added felt to the back of the board, and a felt 
                hexagon to encompass the front of the board and cushion the back of the pieces. In the attached image, you can see my makeshift compass, for scribing a large enough 
                circle, and you can also make out the circles that I drew to help me perfectly scribe the hexagon. Thanks, Euclid!
            </p>
            <p><img src="/Photos/catan_board_5.jpg" style='float:left;width:400px;height:400px; margin-right:10px;'>Finally, some finishing touches. I added a picture hanging 
                mount on the back of the board (to...hang the board, of course), and broke out the acrylic paints to make a crashing-waves motif in the board’s empty space. 
                At this point, I’m calling the design finished -- however, I think I will come back to this in the future and design a nice wood frame to really finish the edge 
                of the board and pull everything together. Until next time!
            </p>
